Okay, fantastic! Vite with VS Code is a *very* strong combination for this project. It’s going to significantly speed up development and ensure a smooth workflow. Let’s update the PRD to reflect this.

**Product Requirements Document: Fruitful Fortune Slot Machine (TypeScript & PixiJS - Vite & VS Code)**

**1. Introduction**

* **Product Name:** Fruitful Fortune
* **Product Category:** Casual Game / Arcade Game
* **Platform:** Web Browser (Initially – PixiJS is well-suited for this)
* **Target Audience:** Casual gamers, people who enjoy simple, engaging arcade-style games.
* **Product Goal:** To provide a fun, engaging, and potentially addictive slot machine experience with a rewarding progression system.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To create a compelling and enjoyable slot machine experience that keeps players engaged and encourages them to continue playing (within reasonable limits).
* **Secondary Goals:**
    * Achieve a high level of user engagement (measured by average session length, number of spins per session).
    * Generate positive user reviews and word-of-mouth.
    * Establish a foundation for potential future features (e.g., bonus rounds, different themes).

**3. Features**

| Feature Category | Feature Description | Priority | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Gameplay** | Spin Button | High | Allows the player to initiate a spin. Should have a visual animation (e.g., spinning reels) – implemented using PixiJS’s animation capabilities. |
|  | Reel Mechanics | High | Implement the 7 symbols with the specified rarity distribution (Seven - rarest, Cherry - most common). Random number generation (RNG) for each symbol – leveraging TypeScript’s type safety for the symbol data. |
|  | Winning Combinations | High | Implement all winning combinations as defined in the requirements (3 across, 3 down, 3 diagonal, 4 across, 5 across, 5 mirrored diagonal, 9 square, 15 all match jackpot). Calculate payouts based on the combination and multiplier. |
|  | Coin System | High | Players start with a set number of coins. Each spin costs 1 coin. Visual representation of remaining coins – using TypeScript to manage the coin count. |
|  | Multiplier System | High | Starting with 1x multiplier for 3 across/3 down wins. Increase multiplier based on winning combinations (e.g., 5 across = 2x multiplier, Jackpot = 5x multiplier). |
| **Visuals & Audio** | Symbol Design | High | High-quality, visually appealing graphics for each of the 7 symbols. Consistent art style.  Imported as PixiJS textures. |
|  | Reel Design | High | Realistic or stylized reel design. Consider visual effects for winning combinations (e.g., flashing lights, celebratory animations) – using PixiJS’s particle effects or animation blending. |
|  | Sound Effects | Medium | Appropriate sound effects for spinning reels, winning combinations, coin collection, and other relevant actions – imported as PixiJS audio files. |
| **TypeScript Specifics** | Symbol Data Types | High | Define TypeScript interfaces for the symbols (e.g., `SymbolType` with properties like `name`, `icon`, `payout`). This improves code maintainability and type safety. |

**4. Release Criteria**

* All core gameplay features are implemented and functioning correctly.
* Visuals and audio are polished and consistent.
* The game is playable in the target web browser.
* Thorough testing has been conducted to identify and fix bugs.
* Performance is acceptable (optimized PixiJS rendering).
* TypeScript code is well-documented and adheres to best practices.

**5. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)**

* **Bonus Rounds:** Introduce bonus rounds with unique features and rewards.
* **Different Themes:** Expand the game with different themes (e.g., Ancient Egypt, Space).
* **Progressive Jackpots:** Implement a system for progressive jackpots.
* **User Interface Enhancements:**  Consider adding a more polished UI with features like a balance display, bet selection, and a history log.

**6. Development Tools & Workflow**

* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **IDE:** VS Code
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Game Engine:** PixiJS
* **Package Manager:** npm or yarn

**7.  Vite Specific Considerations**

* Vite's fast refresh capabilities will significantly reduce development time.
* Vite's use of ES modules will streamline the development process.
*  We'll leverage Vite's plugin ecosystem for tasks like asset management and code linting.
